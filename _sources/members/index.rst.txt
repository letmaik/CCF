Member Governance
=================

This section describes how a consortium of trusted :term:`members` governs an existing CCF network. It explains how members can submit proposals to CCF and how these proposals are accepted based on the rules defined in the :term:`constitution`.

Before creating a new CCF network, the identity of the initial member(s) of the consortium must be generated.

The ``keygenerator`` utility can be used to generate the member's certificate and associated private key. For example, to generate the first member's certificate and private key:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ keygenerator --name member1
    $ ls member1*
    member1_cert.pem member1_privk.pem

The member's private key (e.g. ``member1_privk.pem``) should be stored on a trusted device while the certificate (e.g. ``member1_cert.pem``) should be given to operators before starting the first node of a new CCF network.
